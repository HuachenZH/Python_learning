# v2.4.3 two parts now have combined together.
# modification in function cbind: before, the input of cbind is two string like "3 + 1", now the input of cbind is already the vertical format, so no need to call singleFormatter().
# also in cbind, in the previous version, the output of cbind has a \n at the end, this causes problem. So i delete the \n at the end by extracting the remaining parts
# in singleFormatter, little problem with the if of res, with previous code, traceback will be like: UnboundLocalError: local variable referenced before assignment. Because i haven't defined the value of res when the operator is neither + nor -

# what i've learnt from this version:
	# i wonder if it is a good idea to define so many functions, i spent on checking tracebacks, finding errors

# for the next version:
	# optimized the code and the logic
