# There exists different approaches to print..

# Approach1, "matrix" way.
# A big "matrix", or in Python words, list. An arithmetic format is an element of the list, the element can be a string or a tuple.
# the difficulty is to print them in a vertical way.

# So test the feasibility of this approach.

# I've tried, this does not work

# there is a smart way is to create a data frame, then print the whole data frame directly.
# however with dataframe, we can not configure detail of print (maybe we can, but it is no longer objectif of this project)

# so approach1 abandonned
