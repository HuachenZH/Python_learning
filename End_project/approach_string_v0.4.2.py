#v0.3.1
# no need of if. Comparing to the previous version, greatest change is at line 51. I found a new way to compute the number of spaces in the first line. With this new way, i no longer need an if to distinguish 1 + 10 or 10 + 1
# also, i gave name to two new variables, operand1 and operand2 (they are string)

# what i've learnt from this version:
  # a good maths approach can help reduce lenghty if and for
  # in spyder, line 38, it can get the error of syntax of type in the comment
# for the next version:
  # print several formats in parallel.   solutions like cbind in R aren't feasible in this case (at least, with my level).    Roughly thinking, the solution will still be pur string. Whether i enlarge this script, whether i make this code into a function, then write another function to call this function.
  # and still need to implement this into end_project_v1.py, where there is the code for checking arguments.
