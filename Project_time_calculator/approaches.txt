Approach1: step by step, the 'stupiest' way
	Step1: calculate the minutes first
	Step2: then calculate hour, hour depends on minute
	Step3: then calculate period (AM/PM), period depends on hour
	Step4: at the end, calculate day
Approach2: 'intelligent' way, convert all (original time, duration to add) into minute, then according to the new minute, tell whether it's PM or AM, same day or a few days later
	Step1: calculate the new time in minute, with two scales: absolute scale (from 0 to infinit min) and relative scale (from 0 to 1439 min)
	Step2: get the new period (directly from the new minute calculated in relative scale
	Step3: to see if it change the date or not, if yes, how many days
